            <h1 class="welcome"><strong>Welcome to my portfolio website!</strong></h1>
            <p>
                I am Linda Granados, a student at the University of South Florida, pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
                in Computer Science with an expected graduation date of Fall 2026. Previously, I earned my Associate's 
                degree in Computer Science at Hillsborough Community College.
            </p>
            <p>
                My reason for majoring in Computer Science goes back to when I was in 6th grade taking an elective 
                course of keyboarding. In this course, I learned how to type quickly without looking down at my 
                keyboard with minimal errors. But it also introduced me to a little bit of the hardware of computers 
                and what they do. Since I loved everything that I was learning and was intrigued and wanted to learn more, 
                I took other courses my school was offering in computers and technology. This was anything from Foundations 
                of Programming, Computer and Network Security, Programming Logic, etc. Literally, any class that could somehow
                be related to computers and technology I was signing up for.
            </p>
            <p>With this amount of passion and love I have for this field, I could not have found a better major that I love as much as Computer Science.</p>
            <p>Even now, with the knowledge I have and the challenges I face, I absolutely love every second of this field and its application in our world.</p>
            <p>I love having a vision and being able to execute it out for people to see and use. This could be anything from creating a webpage for people to
                 view and interact with or creating a program that could help a person automate a repetitive but important task.</p>
            <p>With that being said, I personally invite you to look around my site and reach out if you’d like to connect! </p>
            <p>Thank you!</p>
